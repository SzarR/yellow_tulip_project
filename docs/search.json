Here we count the number of observations in our particular demographic responses to better understand the composition of our sample size.\n\nZipcode\n\ndf_final |&gt; \n  count(Zipcode, sort = TRUE)\n\n# A tibble: 40 × 2\n   Zipcode     n\n   &lt;chr&gt;   &lt;int&gt;\n 1 02360       8\n 2 06830       8\n 3 04047       5\n 4 &lt;NA&gt;        5\n 5 04401       4\n 6 01588       3\n 7 04101       3\n 8 01610       2\n 9 04020       2\n10 04090       2\n# ℹ 30 more rows\n\ndf_final &lt;-\n  df_final |&gt; \n  mutate(City = case_when(Zipcode == '02360' ~ 'Plymouth, MA',\n                          Zipcode == '06830' ~ 'Greenwich, CT',\n                          Zipcode == '04047' ~ 'Parsonsfield, ME',\n                          TRUE ~ NA))\n\nA majority of respondents came from two zipcodes: 02360 and 06830. This is Plymouth, MA and Greenwich, CT. The remainder of the zipcodes are from surrounding areas.\n\n\nAge\nWe take a look at the distribution of age in our survey:\n\nggplot(df_final, aes(x=Age))+\n  geom_histogram(color=\"darkblue\", fill=\"lightblue\", binwidth =  3)\n\n\n\n\nThis is a very interesting graphic. We can see that the distribution of our sample is split between around &lt; 40 years of age and &gt; 40 years of age. Therefore, I think it makes sense that the conclusion of this survey regarding the age of the participants is that we are targeting both groups of people, young and elderly. For the purposes of binning the age variable, we should have 40 be the cut-off point.\n\n\nHeard about YTP\nThe three primary “ways” that people hear about Yellow Tulip events is through a friend, their school, or work. This is evidenced in the counts:\n\ndf_final |&gt; \n  count(Hear_ytp, sort = TRUE) |&gt; \n  filter(n &gt; 5)\n\n# A tibble: 3 × 2\n  Hear_ytp     n\n  &lt;chr&gt;    &lt;int&gt;\n1 School      23\n2 Friend      22\n3 Work        11\n\n\nThe only other metric I would track for how people heard about YTP would be social media. Though in the current iteration, this does not seem to be a very high volume of people coming in through social media. This may change in the future, however.\n\n\nGender\n\ndf_final |&gt; \n  count(Gender)\n\n# A tibble: 4 × 2\n  Gender                n\n  &lt;chr&gt;             &lt;int&gt;\n1 Female               36\n2 Male                 11\n3 Prefer not to say     1\n4 &lt;NA&gt;                 25\n\n\nWe had a glitch in the data that has produced a lot of NA values. I believe moving forward this has been corrected. According to the current data, a majority of the survey responses were from females. making up about 75% of the total sample.\n\n\nRace\nWe take a look at our survey responses by Race:\n\ndf_final |&gt; \n  count(Race, sort = TRUE)\n\n# A tibble: 8 × 2\n  Race                                                                         n\n  &lt;chr&gt;                                                                    &lt;int&gt;\n1 White                                                                       42\n2 &lt;NA&gt;                                                                        25\n3 Asian-American or Pacific Islander;Multiracial;Native American/American…     1\n4 Asian-American or Pacific Islander;White                                     1\n5 Black or African American                                                    1\n6 Latinx/Latine/Hispanic                                                       1\n7 Latinx/Latine/Hispanic, White                                                1\n8 White, Native American/American Indian                                       1\n\n\nAfter filtering, our primary composition of attendees is White.

A -1 correlation would indicate a perfect inverse relationship, as one goes up, the other goes down. A positive correlation would indicate as one variable increases, so does the other variable. For example, temperature and number of sunburns. If the correlation is +1, this would indicate that as temperature increases, so does the number of sunburns, which makes perfect sense. A negative correlation with this example could be with snowfall. As temperatures increase, snowfall decreases. This is a negative correlation.\nIn our survey context, we intend to take a look at how our various scale questions correlate with one another. We’d like to see mostly positive correlations, where the more somebody felt connected to an event, the higher probability that they will tell their friends and family about it.\n\ndf_corr &lt;-\n  df_final %&gt;%\n  select(Connected,\n         Reduce_Stigma,\n         More_Hopeful,\n         Future_Attend,\n         Recommend)\n\nM_corr = cor(df_corr, use = \"pairwise.complete.obs\")\nM_test = cor.mtest(df_corr, conf.level = .95)\n\ncorrplot(\n  M_corr,\n  method = 'number',\n  diag = FALSE,\n  type = 'upper',\n  col = COL2('RdBu', 2),\n  p.mat = M_test$p,\n  sig.level = .05,\n  pch.cex = 2,\n  pch.col = \"darkgray\",\n  tl.col = \"black\",\n  tl.srt = 45,\n  #Text label color and rotation\n  tl.cex = 1 / par(\"cex\"),\n  cl.cex = 1 / par(\"cex\")\n)\n\n\n\n\nWe have a lot of statistically significant findings from the survey questions. Some takeaways include:\n\nPeople who are more likely to attend a future event are also more likely to recommend the event to a friend or family member.\nPeople who believe the event is reducing stigma are also more likely to feel hopeful.\nPeople who came to the event and feel more connected are also more likely to attend the event in the future.\nAn interesting observation is that people who are less hopeful also are more likely to attend a future event (-0.12 correlation, not statistically significant). This is an interesting finding because it shows that there are people who are willing to put in the work to continually come to events to become more optimistic/hopeful."

    "text": "Text Analysis: “How can we improve?”\nThis question was difficult to decipher because it seems to be a catch-all for any open-ended text that people want to express about these events in general. Most of the comments in this field were not recommendations at all, but rather, praise about the event. For example:\n\nIt was a lot of fun, and I loved it!\nI was thrilled with the participation in the hooray walk. It was amazing to have activities for participants at the end.\nIt was fantastic!\n\nThese types of comments were mixed in with actual recommendations, such as:\n\nMore widespread event promotion and publicity.\nI feel that we tried to put 2 events in one. I think the panel discussion should have been the following night.\n\nTherefore, any sort of word cloud analysis that we’d like to implement will be mixed in terms of how the words should be interpreted. As a majority of the comments were positive feedback, we can interpret the word cloud as representing general feedback about the performance of YTP over the last year.\n\ntokens_clean &lt;-\ndf_final |&gt; \n  unnest_tokens(input = Text_Improve,output = 'word') |&gt; \n  select(word) |&gt; \n  anti_join(stop_words) |&gt; \n  filter(!is.na(word)) |&gt; \n  count(word)\n\npal &lt;- brewer.pal(8,\"Dark2\")\n\ntokens_clean %&gt;% \n  with(wordcloud(word, n, random.order = FALSE, max.words = 25, colors=pal))"
